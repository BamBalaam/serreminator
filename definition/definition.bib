abstract = {This note improves the results of Zheng, Wang, and Lee (Automatica 38 (2002) 517) on the design of multivariable PID controllers via LMI approach. The idea of the improvement is to transform the problem of PID controller design to that of static output feedback (SOF) controller design for a system in descriptor form. The merits of the present result are: (1) The present condition removes the invertibility constraint on the controllers in Zheng et al. (2002) and incorporates it to the matrix inequality to be solved. (2) Once the SOF matrix is obtained, the PID gains are ready in hand and no additional computation is needed. (3) The present approach can deal with the case of some system parameters subject to perturbations. Â© 2003 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

@article{Knospe2006,
abstract = {The PID controller is the most common form of feedback. It was an essential element of early governors and it became the standard tool when process control emerged in the 1940s. In process control today, more than 95{\%} of the control loops are of PID type, most loops are actually PI control. PID controllers are today found in all areas where control is used. The controllers come in many different forms. There are standalone systems in boxes for one or a few loops, which are manufactured by the hundred thousands yearly. PID control is an important ingredient of a distributed control system. The controllers are also embedded in many specialpurpose control systems. PID control is often combined with logic, sequential functions, selectors, and simple function blocks to build the complicated automation systems used for energy production, transportation, and manufacturing. Many sophisticated control strategies, such as model predictive control, are also organized hierarchically. PID control is used at the lowest level; the multivariable controller gives the setpoints to the controllers at the lower level. The PID controller can thus be said to be the bread and buttertt of control engineering. It is an important component in every control engineers tool box.},

@article{Caelen2006,
abstract = {The growing availability of high throughput measurement devices in the operating room makes possible the collection of a huge amount of data about the state of the patient and the doctors' practice during a surgical operation. This paper explores the possibility of extracting from these data relevant information and pertinent decision rules in order to support the daily anesthesia procedures. In particular we focus on machine learning strategies to design a closed-loop controller that, in a near future, could play the role of a decision support tool and, in a further perspective, the one of automatic pilot of the anesthesia procedure. Two strategies (direct and inverse) for learning a controller from observed data are assessed on the basis of a database of measurements collected in recent years by the ULB Erasme anaesthesiology group. The preliminary results of the learning approach applied to the regulation of hypnosis through the bispectral index (BIS) in a simulated framework appear to be promising and worthy of future investigation},
